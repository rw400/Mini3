	<h2>Future of the Gaming World: <br></h2> <!-- link break to format spacing-->
	
	<!-- start paragraph-->
	<p>	Technology in the gaming indusrty is constantly changing at a rapid pace. With the rise of 4K TVs and virtual reality,
		the demand for faster hardware is more than ever. We are now combining movement and motion controls 
		in a completely fictional space for a greater immersive feel. Although VR may be only for the 1% in the world, the 
		gaming industry is splitting into another realm. With the successful launch of Pokemon Go, Nintendo 
		introduced Augmented Reality worldwide and has once again changed people's persective. AR at this current moment
		integrates and projects digital images onto real life environments. Even though no one can be certain, Augmented Reality will 
		most likely triumph in our everyday lives. AR appeals to the whole public and it is a lot less hardware intensive. Just take a
		look at Pokemon Go, all you need was a smart phone to download the free app. The Nintendo 3DS also had an extremely basic AR projection.
		<br><br>
		The Nintendo switch might be disappointing to a lot of fans because of their lack of performance once again but I believe
		Nintendo is moving away from competiting against Xbox and PS4. Japan is always looking for new and fun
		ways to innovate gaming for a whole new audience. For example, the wii introduced motion controls and the game cube had a portable handle!
		The Nintendo switch is still definitely still years behind a true AR console but the ideas are there. From the whole system 
		being portable to the new IR senors and the new detachable controllers. They will most likely roll out a new headset that attaches the screen to your face 
		just like the Google Cardboard except a lot more fancy and more expensive. Don't forget about all the additional proprietary cables and connections
		you will need to buy!
